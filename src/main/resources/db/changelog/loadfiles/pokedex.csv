2,"Ivysaur",10,130,"Seed Pokémon","There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight,
Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong.
If it starts spendingx more time lying in the sunlight,

to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.
The flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people."

a bluish white color."

It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything.
However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent
weaker than itself."
7,"Squirtle",5,90,"Tiny Turtle Pokémon","Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection.
The shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its
surface help minimize resistance in water,
enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds."
8,"Wartortle",10,225,"Turtle Pokémon","Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail
becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages.
The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s
toughness as a battler."
9,"Blastoise",16,855,"Shellfish Pokémon","Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell.
The water spouts are very accurate.
They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy

it one of the top recommendations for novice
Pokémon Trainers."

with it should be avoided."

itself by scattering its poisonous scales and
fluttering its wings."

of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it
dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."
14,"Kakuna",6,100,"Cocoon Pokémon","Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree.
However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares
for its coming evolution.
This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch."

It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest,
however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."

is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe
with its sharp claws."
18,"Pidgeot",15,395,"Bird Pokémon","This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully
glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the
striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling
them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon."

live in dirty places without concern. Left

position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any
direction with a glare from its upraised head."
24,"Arbok",35,650,"Cobra Pokémon","This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things
with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok
wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace
is impossible."
25,"Pikachu",4,60,"Mouse Pokémon","It’s in its nature to store electricity. It feels
stressed now and then if it’s unable to fully
discharge the electricity."
26,"Raichu",8,300,"Mouse Pokémon","It becomes aggressive when it has electricity
stored up. At such times, even its Trainer has to
take care to avoid being attacked."
27,"Sandshrew",6,120,"Mouse Pokémon","It usually makes its home in deserts and arid
zones, where rain does not fall. It digs holes to
catch Bug-type Pokémon."
28,"Sandslash",10,295,"Mouse Pokémon","It uses its claws to climb trees and then curls
its body into a spiny ball, ready to drop onto
any prey that appears."
29,"Nidoran♀",4,70,"Poison Pin Pokémon","Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison.
They are thought to have developed as protection for
this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases
a horrible toxin from its horn."
30,"Nidorina",8,200,"Poison Pin Pokémon","When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep
their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other.
This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated
from the others."
31,"Nidoqueen",13,600,"Drill Pokémon","Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales.
It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This
Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young."
32,"Nidoran♂",5,90,"Poison Pin Pokémon","Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks
to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even
the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice."

a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once,
and it challenges the foe with all its might."
34,"Nidoking",14,620,"Drill Pokémon","Nidoking’s thick tail packs enormously destructive power.

The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can
differ slightly from colony to colony."

fly anymore. Then they fall to the ground and
become food for other Pokémon."

During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet
are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots
of trees."

horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the
noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey."

attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the

active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather
around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness."

because its droppings enrich the soil it lives in."

and farmers and other people, no one has ever
seen the parts of it concealed underground."
52,"Meowth",4,42,"Scratch Cat Pokémon","It loves shiny things. It often fights with
Murkrow over prey they’re both trying to catch."
53,"Persian",10,320,"Classy Cat Pokémon","It has a high opinion of itself, although not to
the same extent as the Alolan Persian. It’s quite
difficult to make friends with this Pokémon."
54,"Psyduck",8,196,"Duck Pokémon","This Pokémon is troubled by constant
headaches. The more pain it’s in, the more
powerful its psychokinesis becomes."
55,"Golduck",17,766,"Duck Pokémon","It swims along the banks of lakes and catches
fish Pokémon. It takes them to the shore and
quietly eats them up."
56,"Mankey",5,280,"Pig Monkey Pokémon","Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep,
but the anger resonating in its dreams causes it
to wake up—which infuriates it all over again."
57,"Primeape",10,320,"Pig Monkey Pokémon","Some researchers theorize that Primeape
remains angry even when inside a Poké Ball."

energy to fuel it as it runs great distances.
It appears in many legends."
60,"Poliwag",6,124,"Tadpole Pokémon","It’s still not very good at walking. Its Trainers
should train this Pokémon to walk every day."
61,"Poliwhirl",10,200,"Tadpole Pokémon","It marches over the land in search of bug
Pokémon to eat. Then it takes them underwater
so it can dine on them where it’s safe."
62,"Poliwrath",13,540,"Tadpole Pokémon","Its percentage of body fat is nearly zero. Its
body is entirely muscle, which makes it heavy
and forces its swimming prowess to develop."
63,"Abra",9,195,"Psi Pokémon","It can teleport itself to safety while it’s asleep,
but when it wakes, it doesn’t know where it is,
so it panics."
64,"Kadabra",13,565,"Psi Pokémon","Kadabra’s presence infests televisions and
monitors with creepy shadows that bring
bad luck."
65,"Alakazam",15,480,"Psi Pokémon","Its brain cells continue to increase in number
until its death. The older the Alakazam, the
larger its head."
66,"Machop",8,195,"Superpower Pokémon","With its superhuman strength, it’s able to throw
a hundred people all at the same time. Its
strength comes from lifting Graveler every day."

knows the work is good training for its muscles."

fingers prevent it from doing any precision work."

to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth,
this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron."

Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep.
If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself
on the ground."
71,"Victreebel",17,155,"Flycatcher Pokémon","Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head.

to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near,
this Pokémon swallows it whole."

beaches. If you get bitten or stabbed by its
toxic tentacles, rush to the hospital."

outbreak of them occurs, all fish Pokémon
disappear from the surrounding sea."

road. A scholar with too much free time once
counted a hundred of them along a single route."

and rolling instead of walking. With enough
momentum, its speed can exceed 60 mph."

shell returns to the soil. This process creates

This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and
falling to keep up with its parent."

tails and then simmering them into a salty stew."

it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it
forgets a moment later."

float through the air. Touching it while it’s eating
electricity will give you a full-body shock."

Magnemite. For some reason, outbreaks of this
Pokémon happen when lots of sunspots appear."

sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This
Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks."
84,"Doduo",14,392,"Twin Bird Pokémon","Doduo’s two heads contain completely identical brains. A
scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be
examples of this Pokémon possessing different sets of brains."
85,"Dodrio",18,852,"Triple Bird Pokémon","Apparently, the heads aren’t the only parts of the body that
Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as
well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest."
86,"Seel",11,900,"Sea Lion Pokémon","Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice.
When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice
with the sharply protruding section of its head."

this Pokémon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought
to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago."

exposure to X-rays from the moon. When its

be on the verge of extinction in cities that stay
brightly lit at night."

Since it was once human itself, it tries to create
one by taking the lives of other humans."
95,"Onix",88,2100,"Rock Snake Pokémon","Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that
this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling.
As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder
and smoother."

friends with people, it may show them the most
delicious dreams it’s ever eaten."

fall asleep and has a taste of their dreams.
Anyone having a good dream, it carries off."
98,"Krabby",4,65,"River Crab Pokémon","Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into
the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food,
these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other
over territory."
99,"Kingler",13,600,"Pincer Pokémon","Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge
claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because
the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires."

of shocks. It is rumored that it was first created when a
Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy."

It is a problematical Pokémon that congregates mostly at
electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just
been generated."

Pokémon. It’s often hunted by Crabrawler,
but uses psychokinesis to drive it off."

falls off. Before long, the fallen head grows into
an Exeggcute."

mother. According to some, it will evolve when
it comes to terms with the pain of her death."

enemy, Mandibuzz. It throws bones like
boomerangs to try to take it down."

has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face
of adversity."
108,"Lickitung",12,655,"Licking Pokémon","Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will
unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things
by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things."
109,"Koffing",6,10,"Poison Gas Pokémon","Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw
garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly
powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas
is concocted by this Pokémon."
110,"Weezing",12,95,"Poison Gas Pokémon","Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix
together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed,
the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also
becomes more putrid."
111,"Rhyhorn",10,1150,"Spikes Pokémon","Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run
it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently
remembers sometimes if it demolishes something."
112,"Rhydon",19,1200,"Drill Pokémon","Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for
destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokémon occasionally
rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents
it from feeling the heat."

they’re also few in number, so anyone who finds
one must be lucky indeed."

The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very
next day."

three years. That is the only time the mother is
heard to cry wildly."
116,"Horsea",4,80,"Dragon Pokémon","If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense
black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pokémon
swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back."
117,"Seadra",12,250,"Dragon Pokémon","Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body.
The whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even
fishing boats. This Pokémon weakens prey with
these currents, then swallows it whole."

beauty of its fins, many strange Trainers raise
Goldeen and nothing but Goldeen."
119,"Seaking",13,390,"Goldfish Pokémon","Trainers who are crazy for Seaking are divided
into horn enthusiasts and fin enthusiasts.
The two groups do not get along well."

fast, so it’s unconcerned by their snack attacks."

art, led local people to spread rumors that this
Pokémon may be an invader from outer space."
122,"Mr. Mime",13,545,"Barrier Pokémon","Mr. Mime is a master of pantomime. Its gestures and motions

mountains, training themselves in how to fight
with their scythes and move at high speeds."

giving any thought to what they are doing."

than the amount of electricity it eats."

over its body. It doesn’t calm down until its
opponent has burned to ash."

apart a large tree. Its greatest rival in Alola
is Vikavolt."

Tauros in the Alola region are said to possess
a measure of calmness."

of its presence, it patiently waits for its prey,
fish Pokémon."

believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too
large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow
and ponderous."

However, in extremely rare cases, living examples have
been discovered. The Pokémon has not changed at all for
300 million years."

times. The Pokémon was apparently evolving from being a
water dweller to living on land as evident from the beginnings
of change in its gills and legs."

of humans created this Pokémon’s body, they failed to
endow Mewtwo with a compassionate heart."

Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will,
so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people."
152,"Chikorita",9,64,"Leaf Pokémon","In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at

becalming the battling Pokémon and creating a cozy,
friendly atmosphere all around."

nipping, its bite has enough power to cause serious injury."
159,"Croconaw",11,250,"Big Jaw Pokémon","Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will
absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are
forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible
to remove when they have sunk in."

minimal light, and to its soft, supple wings that make no sound
in flight."

fluids that give off odors. When they’re angry,
their odor smells sour."

The power of each individual blow is piddly,
so it aims to win by quantity rather than quality."

then shares them with others."

wool. The bare and slick parts of its hide are shielded
against electricity."

Pokémon closes its petals and goes to sleep."

balloons if it spots a drowning Pokémon. The air balloons

foreign lands. The Pokémon descends to the ground when it
encounters cold air while it is floating."

manipulated. However, because the Pokémon uses its tail so
much, its real hands have become rather clumsy."
191,"Sunkern",3,18,"Seed Pokémon","Sunkern tries to move as little as it possibly can. It does so

body for its evolution. It will not eat a thing, subsisting only on

a gooey, toxic film."
